Recently, one of the issues currently in the news is the 
[court order to Apple](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/judge-apple-must-help-fbi-unlock-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone/).
In this court order, Apple is being forced to bypass *all* 
security features to allow the government to access the 
device. As this case became more popular, online 
commenters noticed that in court, one could argue that 
the 2nd amendment might apply. Many in the tech community
consider encryption a weapon that a person has the right
to own. In my own view, I agree with this commenters and 
feel that the government should not be allowed to order a 
company to spend valuable time and resources on breaking 
something that is theoretically impossible and create a 
backdoor that any country could use on their people.
